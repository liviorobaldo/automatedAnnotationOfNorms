This subfolder contains the JavaScript tool that was distributed to the annotators to enable them to annotate additional regulative norms from UK Acts.

The JavaScript code is <i>static</i>, meaning that it is configured for a single UK Act. In this GitHub repository, the code refers specifically to the "Children and Families Act 2014", located in the "acts" subfolder. The link to this act is hard-coded in the file index.html.

To use the tool, the annotator should open index.html, copy text from the Act displayed on the right, and fill in the template slots on the left by pasting the text into the corresponding text fields and selecting the appropriate keywords from the drop-down menus.

By clicking "Add annotations", the text entered into the slots is added to the list of annotations collected so far, which can be viewed by clicking "Show annotations done so far". This opens a text area where the annotator can edit the text. Annotators are requested by the guidelines to edit the text for two main reasons:
- To add conditions under which the regulative norms apply. The tool allows at most two conditions, since legislative norms typically contain no more than two, although in rare cases they may include three or more.
- To slightly paraphrase the text for fluency, while keeping modifications to a minimum.
